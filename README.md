# JavaScript Frontend vs Backend Demo

An interactive educational project demonstrating the differences and relationship between client-side and server-side JavaScript through visual animations and interactive components.

## Overview

This project contains two main demonstrations:

1. **Interactive Components Demo** - Showcases client-side JavaScript capabilities with dropdown menus, image carousels, and interactive buttons
2. **Client-Server Architecture Animation** - Visual representation of how JavaScript powers both frontend (browser) and backend (Node.js) with an animated request-response cycle

## Features

### Interactive Components Demo ([index.html](index.html))
- Dropdown menu with dynamic selection feedback
- Auto-advancing image carousel with manual controls
- Interactive buttons with visual feedback
- Smooth animations and modern UI design
- Responsive layout

### Client-Server Architecture Demo ([client-server-animation.html](client-server-animation.html))
- Visual architecture diagram showing client and server components
- Animated data packets demonstrating request-response flow
- Step-by-step interactive simulation of the request-response cycle
- Educational content explaining:
  - Client-side JavaScript responsibilities
  - Server-side JavaScript (Node.js) capabilities
  - Why JavaScript is used for both frontend and backend
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project
